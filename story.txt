Bill is a student at UW Madison and is in a gas station deciding what snack to buy.


Maybe Bill should attend the fiesta instead of buying gas-station snacks.
The story goes that there is another student at UW madison who tried to go 
to that fiesta, but he got stung by a spider. Or maybe eaten by an octopus... 
not sure which...


That's the rumor. But the story actually runs much deeper than that. There
actually never was any fiesta. At UW-Madison, "fiesta" is a code word 
for CIA spies that act as students here. The public was lead to believe
that Bill was eaten by an octopus because the CIA did not want their story
getting out.

When Bill decides to throw the spider away and stamp it, the spider suddenly
tells him that he could help bill to achieve a dream.

The dream he could achieve is his dream of opening up his own gas station. 
He has always loved the snacks there, going so far as to miss a fiesta just
to purchase them. However, he never had enough money and business knowledge
to open one.

The spider suddenly turns a piles of bricks into gold and said: "I will help
you achieve your dream but you must promise me one thing".
"So what do you want me to do?"
"You have to come here every full moon night until you achieve your dream"
"I don't understand... Okey, I promise" 

Every full moon Bill came back and the spider kept giving him the tools to 
make the gas station succeed. When something broke the next full moon the equipment 
would magically be fixed. Bill and the spider became the best gas station in the state
and made millions.
