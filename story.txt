Bill is a student at UW Madison and is in a gas station deciding what snack to buy.


Maybe Bill should attend the fiesta instead of buying gas-station snacks.
The story goes that there is another student at UW madison who tried to go 
to that fiesta, but he got stung by a spider. Or maybe eaten by an octopus... 
not sure which...

That's the rumor. But the story actually runs much deeper than that. There
actually never was any fiesta. At UW-Madison, "fiesta" is a code word 
for CIA spies that act as students here. The public was lead to believe
that Bill was eaten by an octopus because the CIA did not want their story
getting out.
