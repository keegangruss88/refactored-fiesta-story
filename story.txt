Bill is a student at UW Madison and is in a gas station deciding what snack to buy.


Maybe Bill should attend the fiesta instead of buying gas-station snacks.
The story goes that there is another student at UW madison who tried to go 
to that fiesta, but he got stung by a spider. Or maybe eaten by an octopus... 
not sure which...

When Bill decides to throw the spider away and stamp it, the spider suddenly
tells him that he could help bill to achieve a dream.
