Bill is a student at UW Madison and is in a gas station deciding what snack to buy.


Maybe Bill should attend the fiesta instead of buying gas-station snacks.
The story goes that there is another student at UW madison who tried to go 
to that fiesta, but he got stung by a spider. Or maybe eaten by an octopus... 
not sure which...
